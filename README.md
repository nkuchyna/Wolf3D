# Wolf3D
Simple game based on ray casting with dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way | UNIT Factory
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Main goal of this project was to create a 3D graphically “realistic” representation that we could have from inside a maze in a subjective view using Ray-Casting principles.
-> SDL graphics library was used. According to the subject, we were allowed to use only some basic library features (keyboard and mouse events management, window creation, loading of the textures, coloring of the screen pixel).

- You can choose the size and the shape of your labyrinth by changing game maps.
- Game map description: 0 - empty place; 1-9 wall texture, according to legend, which user can add to the game map file; e - exit; p - player position.
- Game has 3 levels.
- The goal of the game - to find exit from the maze.
- Control - WASD or arrows, M - menu.

BONUS PART
- levels;
- simple torch animation;
- menu realization;
- textures management from level maps;
- floor and ceiling texturing;
- simple light management.
